# Verification Instructions for FastAPI Upgrade

This document provides instructions for verifying that the FastAPI upgrade solution works correctly and resolves the dependency conflict issue from PR #68.

## Quick Verification

Run the included simulation test:

```bash
./test_solution.sh
```

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Create a fresh virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install using the dependency-safe method:

```bash
./install.sh
```

### 3. Verify no pandas/numpy conflicts:

```bash
python3 src/test_dependencies.py
```

### 4. Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 5. Run all tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

### 6. Verify linting:

```bash
ruff check .
black . --check
```

### 7. Test the application:

```bash
fastapi dev src/api/main.py
```

## Expected Results

- ✅ FastAPI upgraded from 0.111.0 to 0.114.0
- ✅ No pandas or numpy dependencies installed
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ Linting and formatting checks pass

## Fallback Installation

If the main installation script encounters issues, use the pinned requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-pinned.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

1. Delete the virtual environment: `rm -rf .venv`
2. Create a new one: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Use the installation script: `./install.sh`
4. Verify with the dependency test: `python3 src/test_dependencies.py`

This approach resolves the original issue by carefully managing dependency installation order and preventing pandas/numpy from being pulled in as transitive dependencies.
